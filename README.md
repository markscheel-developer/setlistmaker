This JS Programm can be used for organizing titles in a live performance .
You have 4 sets  with 10 titles each. You can change the order by dragging the songtitles around,
add or delete titles as you like.\
Setlistmaker is written in  Vanilla JS with the HTML5 DnD Api.
It is optimized for mobile Devices.
Since mobile Browsers lack the HTML5 DnD Api  I needed to add  Poly-touch.js 
as the only dependency in the programm.\
To see the programm in action you go to
